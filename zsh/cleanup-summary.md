# Zsh Configuration Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed zsh2000 Theme
- Cloned from: https://github.com/consolemaverick/zsh2000
- Installed to: `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/zsh2000.zsh-theme`

### 2. Reorganized .zshrc Configuration
- Moved Oh My Zsh configuration to the top (required for proper loading)
- Removed duplicate Oh My Zsh configuration sections
- Cleaned up commented-out code

### 3. Enhanced Oh My Zsh Setup
- Added useful plugins:
  - `zsh-syntax-highlighting` - Syntax highlighting for commands
  - `zsh-autosuggestions` - Fish-like autosuggestions

### 4. Configuration Structure
The cleaned configuration now follows this order:
1. Oh My Zsh configuration and loading
2. Environment variables
3. PATH configuration
4. Aliases
5. Tool integrations (zoxide, mcfly, homebrew)
6. Additional settings (history, NVM)
7. Enhanced configuration imports

## To Apply Changes
```bash
source ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zshrc
# or simply open a new terminal
```

## Troubleshooting
If the theme doesn't appear correctly:
1. Ensure your terminal supports 256 colors
2. Check that font supports powerline symbols
3. Try: `echo $ZSH_THEME` to verify the theme is set

## Recommended Fonts
For best results with zsh2000 theme, use a Powerline-compatible font:
- Meslo LG
- Fira Code
- JetBrains Mono
- Hack Nerd Font
